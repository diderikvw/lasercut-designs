Experimenting with creating a lamp shade using plywood and the lasercutter. Using the curved wood projects as a base, see folder curved-wood.

Try 1:
- curved-wood-sample-3-double-part.svg, save copy as DXF
- Load in RDWorks
- Plywood 3mm Gamma
- Laser settings for BCN at Fab Lab Mariahoeve: Cut, Speed 25 mm/s, Min power 60%, Max power 65%, Laser through mode Through power1 50.0%

Try 2:
- First try had 'double lines' in the path, cut piece looks okay though, bends ok
- New conversion in Inkscape, ended up with single lines
- curved-wood-sample-3-single-part.svg, save copy as DXF
- Load in RDWorks
- Same wood, same laser settings

Try 3:
- lamp-shade-tryout-1.svg
- Used Inkscape tile function: Menu Edit => Clone => Create tiled clones, see https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/repeating-patterns-made-easy-in-inkscape--cms-20284
- Create an object of 1 single repeating pattern
- Tiling: 80cm wide, 8cm high
- Same wood and laser settings
